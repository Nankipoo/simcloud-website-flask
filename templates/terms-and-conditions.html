  <!--TERMS AND CONDITIONS-->

  <div class="terms-main">
    <div class="container custom2-blue-background">
      <h1 class="whitesmoke-heading-xxlarge">Terms and Conditions</h1>
      <br>

      <p class="container custom-blue-background whitesmoke-text-left"> <br> By the act of registration and by making
        payment
        you agree to purchase
        Airtime and/or data at
        the ICASA approved
        pricing in terms of the offering on this website.
        <br>
        <br>
        All marketing information, commands, know-how and technical information contained in the Website form part of
        the
        operating system of the Vendor and are subject to change at the sole discretion of the Networks and/or the
        Vendor.
        <br>
        <br>
        The intellectual property in the Airtime delivery platform is proprietary software. The information contained on
        this site is subject to change without notice. There is no registration fee, and no additional charges are
        applicable for the use of this free service.
        <br>
        <br>
        The availability of the service is based on sufficient positive balance being available in the wallet of the
        account
        holder. Failed orders are not charged for and are refunded into the wallet.
        <br>
        <br>
        The Airtime is only available at the quoted prices to South African clients who pay by EFT or using cell phone
        banking. If you pay cash into our account, we recover the bank charges levied against our account by the Bank.
        No identical value payment may be made into our bank account within seven days of any prior identical value
        payment.
        The paying party agrees to put (only) the mobile number associated with the account as the reference number when
        transferring funds. Any error in this regard will cause the affected payment to be allocated to a suspense
        account
        and manual intervention will be required to rectify, attracting an admin fee of R150, per time.
        <br>
        <br>
        We will not share your personal details with any outside party, unless compelled to do so by law. By the act of
        registering, you agree to these terms and agree that we may correspond with you by E-mail regarding our Airtime
        services. We shall not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, consequential or other damage alleged
        once
        a
        valid recharge has been requested. Payments made into our account are non-refundable and can only be redeemed as
        airtime or data.
